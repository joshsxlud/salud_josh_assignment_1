## Assignment
Assignment 1, grasping the basics of git and github. 

# first git status output:
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

# second git status output: 
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

# Purpose of the following Commands:
- `mkdir`: creates a new directory.
- `cd`:changes the working directory.
- `code`: launches Visual Studio Code.
- `ls`: displays the files within the current working directory.

# Why Version Control is Important
## with version control, it is possible to:
- Stay organized, track changes made to files and directories. With version control it is possible to reflect and compare with previous versions to better understand the code. 
- Collaborate with other users, by allowing multiple users to access, modify and make changes/contribute to a project without conflict. 
- Create branches of the same project. This allows users to work independently, test for proper functionality, and eventually merge back into the original branch. 
- Control user access to certain parts of a project, to ensure that only authorized user can make changes to certain parts of a project, such as the master branch. 

# purpose of the following git commands used in the assignment:
- `git init`: Used to create a git repository in a directory that previously did not one. 
- `git add`: Adds changes made to the staging area. 
- `git status`: Displays the staging area for changes to be commited. 
- `git commit`: Records the changes made (locally), which should include a comment including the changes made. 
- `git push`: Sends the changes made to a remote repository (GitHub), from a locally stored repository.
- `git pull`: Downloads the changes from a remote repository into the local repository. Will merge the current local branch with the remote branch automatically, 
              if there are no conflicts.   
- `git branch`: Creates a working copy of the master branch that exist independently from the master. 
- `git checkout`: Used to switch the current working branch. 
- `git merge`: Used to combine the changes made in a different branch into another branch. 
- `git log`: Displays all previous commits from a git repositories history.
